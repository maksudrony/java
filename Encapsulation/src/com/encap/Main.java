/*Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental OOP concepts. The other three are inheritance, polymorphism, and
 *  abstraction. Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the 
 *  data (methods) together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from 
 *  other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also 
 *  known as data hiding.
To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’
Declare the variables of a class as private.
Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.*/
/*
 * 
Create a class and demonstrate proper encapsulation techniques
the class will be called Printer
It will simulate a real Computer Printer
It should have fields for the toner Level, number of pages printed, and
also whether its a duplex printer (capable of printing on both sides of the paper).
Add methods to fill up the toner (up to a maximum of 100%), another method to
simulate printing a page (which should increase the number of pages printed).
Decide on the scope, whether to use constructors, and anything else you think is needed.
